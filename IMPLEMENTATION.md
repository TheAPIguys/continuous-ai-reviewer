# Git Diff & Agent Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the core GitWatcher and Agent components for the Continuous AI Reviewer extension. The extension now monitors Git repositories and generates review files.

## Components Created/Updated

### 1. **src/gitWatcher.ts** (NEW)
A polling-based Git watcher that:
- Polls `git rev-parse HEAD` every 5 seconds to detect new commits
- Uses `git diff --name-only <old> <new>` to get changed files between commits
- Implements `vscode.Disposable` for proper cleanup
- Calls `Agent.processChanges()` asynchronously when changes are detected
- Logs all activity to the OutputChannel

**Key Methods:**
- `getCurrentHeadHash()` - Gets current commit hash
- `checkForNewCommit()` - Polls for changes
- `getChangedFiles()` - Gets list of changed files between commits
- `handleNewCommit()` - Processes newly detected commits

### 2. **src/agent.ts** (NEW)
An agent component that:
- Receives changed files and commit range from GitWatcher
- Generates review markdown files at `review/review.md`
- Creates the review directory if it doesn't exist
- Provides a stub implementation for local review generation
- Structured for future Copilot Agent integration

**Key Methods:**
- `processChanges()` - Main entry point for processing
- `generateReviewContent()` - Stub that creates markdown with timestamp and file list
- `writeReviewFile()` - Writes review to `review/review.md`

### 3. **src/extension.ts** (UPDATED)
Refactored to implement the startup workflow:
- Activates on `onStartupFinished` event
- Creates OutputChannel for logging
- Validates workspace folder exists
- Instantiates Agent and GitWatcher
- Properly registers disposables for cleanup

### 4. **package.json** (UPDATED)
- Changed `activationEvents` from `[]` to `["onStartupFinished"]`
- Removed hello-world command from contributes
- Extension now starts on VS Code startup

## How It Works

1. **Extension starts** → `onStartupFinished` activation event fires
2. **OutputChannel created** → All logging goes to "Continuous AI Reviewer" panel
3. **GitWatcher initialized** → Starts polling for new commits
4. **New commit detected** → GitWatcher gets changed files via git diff
5. **Agent processes** → Generates review markdown at `review/review.md`
6. **Output logged** → All activities logged to OutputChannel

## Testing the Implementation

### Debug Mode (F5)
1. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
2. Open the workspace in the dev host
3. Make a new commit in the repo
4. Check "Continuous AI Reviewer" OutputChannel to see logs
5. Look for `review/review.md` file in workspace

### Example Output
```
Continuous AI Reviewer extension activated
Using workspace: /path/to/workspace
[GitWatcher] Initializing Git watcher for: /path/to/workspace
[GitWatcher] Initial HEAD: abc123def456...
[GitWatcher] Started polling (interval: 5000ms)
[GitWatcher] New commit detected: abc123... → def456...
[GitWatcher] Changed files: ["src/file.ts","README.md"]
[Agent] Processing changes for commit range: abc123...def456...
[Agent] Review written to: /path/to/workspace/review/review.md
```

## Review File Example

The generated `review/review.md` will contain:
```markdown
# Code Review

**Generated**: 2025-11-01T10:30:45.123Z

**Commit Range**: `abc123` → `def456`

## Changed Files (2)

- src/file.ts
- README.md

## Review

This is an automated review stub. Future versions will include AI-generated analysis via Copilot Agent integration.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Agent stub** with Copilot Agent endpoint integration
2. **Add credential management** using VS Code SecretStorage
3. **Implement error handling & retries** for network failures
4. **Add comprehensive tests** using `@vscode/test-electron`
5. **Optimize polling** - Consider switching to Git extension API for events

## Build Status ✅

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ ESLint checks passed
- ✅ All components properly typed
- ✅ Ready for testing
